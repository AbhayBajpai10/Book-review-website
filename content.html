  <p>Water pollution can be defined as alteration in physical, chemical or
    biological characteristics of water making it unsuitable for designated
    use in its natural state.<br>
    <h3><b>Sources of water pollution:</b></h3><br> Water is an essential commodity for
    survival. We need water for drinking, cooking, bathing, washing,
    irrigation, and for industrial operations. Most of water for such uses
    comes from rivers, lakes or groundwater sources. Water has the property
    to dissolve many substances in it, therefore, it can easily get polluted.
    Pollution of water can be caused by point sources or non-point sources.
    Point sources are specific sites near water which directly discharge
    effluents into them. Major point sources of water pollution are
    industries, power plants, underground coal mines, offshore oil wells
    etc. The discharge from non-point sources is not at any particular site,
    rather, these sources are scattered, which individually or collectively
    pollute water. Surface run-off from agricultural fields, overflowing small
    drains, rain water sweeping roads and fields, atmospheric deposition
    etc. are the non-point sources of water pollution.<br>
    <h5><b>Ground water pollution:</b></h5> Ground water forms about 6.2% of the
    total water available on planet earth and is about 30 times more than
    surface water (streams, lakes and estuaries). Ground water seems to be
    less prone to pollution as the soil mantle through which water passes
    helps to retain various contaminants due to its cation exchange capacity.
    However, there are a number of potential sources of ground water
    pollution. Septic tanks, industry (textile, chemical, tanneries), deep well
    injection, mining etc. are mainly responsible for ground water pollution,
    which is irreversible. Ground water pollution with arsenic, fluoride
    and nitrate are posing serious health hazards.<br>
    <h5><b>Surface water pollution:</b></h5> The major sources of surface water
    pollution are:<br>
   <h6>1. Sewage:</h6><br> Pouring the drains and sewers in fresh water bodies
    causes water pollution. The problem is severe in cities.<br>
    <h6>2. Industrial effluents: </h6><br>Industrial wastes containing toxic
    chemicals, acids, alkalis, metallic salts, phenols, cyanides,
    ammonia, radioactive substances, etc. are sources of water
    pollution. They also cause thermal (heat) pollution of water.<br>
    <h6>3. Synthetic detergents:</h6><br> Synthetic detergents used in washing
    and cleaning produce foam and pollute water.<br>
    <h6>4. Agrochemicals:</h6><br> Agrochemicals like fertilizers (containing
    nitrates and phosphates) and pesticides (insecticides,
    fungicides, herbicides etc.) washed by rain-water and surface
    run-off pollute water.<br>
   <h6>5. Oil: </h6><br> Oil spillage into sea-water during drilling and shipment
    pollute it.<br>
  <h6>6. Waste heat:</h6><br>  Waste heat from industrial discharges increases
    the temperature of water bodies and affects distribution and
    survival of sensitive species.<br>
    <h3><b>Effects of Water Pollution</b></h3><br>    Following are some important effects of various types of water
    pollutants:<br>
    <i>Oxygen demanding wastes: </i><br>Organic matter which reaches water
    bodies is decomposed by micro-organisms present in water. For this
    degradation oxygen dissolved in water is consumed. Dissolved oxygen
    (DO) is the amount of oxygen dissolved in a given quantity of water at
    a particular temperature and atmospheric pressure. Amount of dissolved
    oxygen depends on aeration, photosynthetic activity in water,
    respiration of animals and plants and ambient temperature.
    The saturation value of DO varies from 8-15 mg/L. For active
    fish species (trout and Salmon) 5-8 mg/L of DO is required whereas
    less desirable species like carp can survive at 3.0 mg/L of DO.
    Lower DO may be harmful to animals especially fish population.
    Oxygen depletion (deoxygenation) helps in release of phosphates from
    bottom sediments and causes eutrophication.
    <br>
    <i>Nitrogen and Phosphorus Compounds (Nutrients):</i><br> Addition of
    compounds containing nitrogen and phosphorus helps in the growth
    of algae and other plants which when die and decay consume oxygen
    of water. Under anaerobic conditions foul smelling gases are produced.
    Excess growth or decomposition of plant material will change the
    concentration of CO2 which will further change pH of water. Changes
    in pH, oxygen and temperature will change many physico-chemical
    characteristics of water.<br>
    <i>Pathogens:</i><br> Many wastewaters especially sewage contain many
    pathogenic (disease causing) and non-pathogenic micro-organisms and
    many viruses. Water borne diseases like cholera, dysentery, typhoid,
    jaundice etc. are spread by water contaminated with sewage.<br>
    <i>Toxic Compounds:</i><br> Pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides,
    cyanides and many other organic and inorganic compounds are harmful
    to aquatic organisms.
    The demand of DO increases with addition of biodegradable
    organic matter which is expressed as biological oxygen demand (BOD).
    BOD is defined as the amount of DO required to aerobically decompose
    biodegradable organic matter of a given volume of water over a period
    of 5 days at 20°C. More BOD values of any water sample are associated
    with poor water quality. The non-biodegradable toxic compounds
    biomagnify in the food chain and cause toxic effects at various levels of
    food chain.
    Some of these substances like pesticides, methyl mercury etc. move
    into the bodies of organisms from the medium in which these organisms
    live. Substances like DDT are not water soluble and have affinity for
    body lipids. These substances tend to accumulate in the organisms
    body. This process is called bioaccumulation. The concentration of
    these toxic substances builds up at successive levels of food chain. This
    process is called biomagnification. Following is the example of
    biomagnification of DDT in aquatic food chain<br>
  
    Toxic substances polluting the water ultimately affect human
    health. Some heavy metals like lead, mercury and cadmium cause
    various types of diseases. Mercury dumped into water is transformed
    into water soluble methyl mercury by bacterial action. Methyl mercury
    accumulates in fish. In 1953, people in Japan suffered from numbness
    of body parts, vision and hearing problems and abnormal mental
    behaviour. This disease called Minamata disease occurred due to
    consumption of methyl mercury contaminated fish caught from
    Minamata bay in Japan. The disease claimed 50 lives and permanently
    paralysed over 700 persons. Pollution by another heavy metal cadmium
    had caused the disease called Itai-itai in the people of Japan. The disease
    was caused by cadmium contaminated rice. The rice fields were irrigated
    with effluents of zinc smelters and drainage water from mines. In this
    disease bones, liver, kidney, lungs, pancreas and thyroid are affected.
    Arsenic pollution of ground water in Bangladesh and West Bengal
    is causing various types of abnormalities.
    Nitrate when present in excess in drinking water causes blue baby
    syndrome or methaemoglobinemia. The disease develops when a part
    of haemoglobin is converted into non-functional oxidized form.
    Nitrate in stomach partly gets changed into nitrites which can
    produce cancer-causing products in the stomach.
    Excess of fluoride in drinking water causes defects in teeth and
    bones called fluorosis.
    Pesticides in drinking water ultimately reach humans and are
    known to cause various health problems. DDT, aldrin, dieldrin etc.
    have therefore, been banned. Recently, in Andhra Pradesh, people
    suffered from various abnormalities due to consumption of endosulphan
    contaminated cashew nuts.<br>
    <h3>Control of Water Pollution</h3>
    It is easy to reduce water pollution from point sources by legislation.
    However, due to absence of defined strategies it becomes difficult to
    prevent water pollution from non-point sources. The following points
    may help in reducing water pollution from non-point sources.
    <i>(i) Judicious use of agrochemicals like pesticides and fertilizers
    which will reduce their surface run-off and leaching. Avoid use of these
    on sloped lands.
    (ii) Use of nitrogen fixing plants to supplement the use of
    fertilizers.
    (iii) Adopting integrated pest management to reduce reliance on
    pesticides.
    136 Environmental Science and Engineering
    (iv) Prevent run-off of manure. Divert such run-off to basin for
    settlement. The nutrient rich water can be used as fertilizer in the fields.
    (v) Separate drainage of sewage and rain water should be provided
    to prevent overflow of sewage with rainwater.
    (vi) Planting trees would reduce pollution by sediments and will
    also prevent soil erosion.
    For controlling water pollution from point sources, treatment of
    wastewaters is essential before being discharged. Parameters which are
    considered for reduction in such water areTotal solids, biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen
    demand (COD), nitrates and phosphates, oil and grease, toxic metals
    etc.</i><br>
    Wastewaters should be properly treated by primary and secondary
    treatments to reduce the BOD, COD levels upto the permissible levels
    for discharge.
    Advanced treatment for removal of nitrates and phosphates will
    prevent eutrophication. Before the discharge of wastewater, it should
    be disinfected to kill the disease-causing organisms like bacteria.
    Proper chlorination should be done to prevent the formation of
    chlorinated hydrocarbons or disinfection should be done by ozone or
    ultraviolet radiations.<br></p>
